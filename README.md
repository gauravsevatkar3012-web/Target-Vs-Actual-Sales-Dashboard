An **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze the gap between **Target vs Actual Sales, highlighting profitability, category performance, discount impact, and regional insights**.  
This project demonstrates how to use **data analysis, DAX measures, and interactive Power BI dashboards to track sales targets vs actuals, evaluate profitability, and deliver business-ready insights**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Sales targets often differ from actual performance, making it critical for businesses to track **revenue variance, profit margins, and discount effectiveness**.  

This dashboard provides:  
- **Revenue & Profit KPIs** (Target vs Actual, YoY Growth %)  
- **Category, Product & Country Performance**  
- **Discount Effectiveness Analysis**  
- **Drill-down Product Level Insights**

📌 **Developed 15+ custom DAX measures** to calculate KPIs such as **revenue variance, YoY growth, profit margin, and discount impact, ensuring accurate and dynamic reporting**.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 📈 **Summary Dashboard** – Actual Vs Target Revenue, Revenue trends (2017–2020), YoY growth, KPI performance  
- 📊 **Overview Dashboard** –  Year,Category & Country level breakdowns  
- 💰 **Discount Effectiveness** – Impact of discounting on sales and margins  
- 📑 **Detailed Analysis** – Product-level cost, sales, discounts, and profit margin

## 📊 Key Metrics
- *Actual Revenue: **50.45M**  
- *Target Revenue: **57M**
- *Revenue Variance: **-6.55M**
- *Profit Margin: **38.51%**
- *Discount Impact: **7.15M**

## 🔍 Actionable Insights
1. **Revenue Shortfall**: Despite **33.87%** YoY growth, sales missed the target by **6.55M** (11.5% gap).  
2. **Category Analysis**:  
   - **Premium** outperformed (21M vs 17M) → Expansion opportunity.  
   - **Standard** lagged heavily (14M vs 29M) → Needs targeted strategy.  
   - **Elite** underperformed moderately (11M vs 16M).  
3. **Profitability**: Margins stable at **~38.5%**, but slightly declining due to discounts.  
4. **Discounts**: Drove **7.15M**in sales impact* but pressured profitability → optimize discounting strategy.  
5. **Regional Performance**: US is the key driver (18M revenue, 7M profit). Other regions (India, UK) need **growth initiatives**.
